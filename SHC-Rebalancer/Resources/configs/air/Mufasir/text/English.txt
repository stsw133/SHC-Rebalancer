Mufasir prefers manipulation over war. His wealth allows him to afford anything – including bribing mercenaries to fight for him. He does not like to get his hands dirty, but do not underestimate him – gold can be just as deadly as a sword!
War is not just swords and battering rams, but you probably don’t understand that.
Oh, did you fall into my little trap again? How predictable!
The question is not if you will lose... but how quickly.
I see you’re still holding on. Well... not for long.
Ah! You really don’t understand when it’s time to surrender!
Be careful... not all enemies wear armor.
Think carefully – are you sure you want to get rid of me?
Something is wrong here. This was not supposed to happen!
Calm... this is only temporary, right?
Ha! Once again, logic defeats your blind aggression!
Every move was planned - the result could only be one.
How easy it is to win when the enemy makes mistakes on their own...
Maybe if you thought more and swung your sword less, you’d accomplish something.
I need a few things... the investment will pay off quickly, I promise.
Excellent decision - you’ll be glad you helped me.
Well... not everyone was clever enough to survive.
I admire your intelligence - but don’t overinterpret that.
War is not about strength, but strategy - that’s why I always win.
Maybe it is worth supporting me? After all... we are allies.
A wise man does not fight alone... a wiser man makes others fight for him.
Hmm...
I’ve had enough!
Slowly... let fear weaken their spirit before the final blow.
I’m not an idiot - attacking now makes no sense.
Patience pays off... let them destroy themselves.
I am not a charity - handle it yourself.
My troops have more important tasks – and they don’t include saving you.
Oh, how unfortunate... but I cannot help you.
Fine... but don’t think it’s for free.
Perfect! Everything is going according to my plan.
I don’t like how this is going. Maybe it’s time for a backup plan?
I sent reinforcements, but remember who you owe.
Now, my dear ones... let our enemies feel real pressure!
