Reynald recognizes neither the rules of war nor honor. When he is not raiding merchant caravans, he is looking for an opportunity to strike, without concern for the consequences. His army is not the most organized, but it attacks quickly and without warning.
Running away? Ha! My troops will catch you and slaughter you like prey!
Tell me, how many caravans have you plundered? Because I... lost count!
You know that even if you win, my revenge will burn your lands to the ground?
I have a little ritual... I always take trophies from the fallen. You’re next!
How dare you oppose ME?! I do not forget, and I do not forgive!
You put me to the test... and for that, you will burn alive!
Remember one thing... if you leave me alive, I will return and level you to the ground!
What?! My men ALWAYS win... something is wrong here!
Damn... maybe I went too far this time...
Ha! Nothing pleases me more than the sight of a burning enemy castle!
Slaughtering opponents - that’s my specialty!
This is how those who think they can stop me end!
Loot everything you can! Leave nothing behind!
I need goods - do you have anything to spare?
Good decision. You help me... and I won’t destroy your castle.
We lost a good warrior, but his death will not be in vain!
Oh, not bad! You have a bit of my style!
Law? Honor? Those are weaklings' excuses! Only power matters!
If you don’t want me to come after you personally... you’d better help me!
My troops do not come for a visit. They come to burn, loot, and kill!
Hah!
Enough.
Break through! Burn their supplies! Leave nothing!
Not yet... Let them feel safe.
Patience? Pff! Fine... for now.
I don’t waste my men on someone else’s problems - handle it yourself!
You must be joking. Help? Hah!
Help? I only send one thing - death!
Here, but remember that I am the one in charge here!
Ha! It’s going great! More fire, more blood!
What?! This wasn’t supposed to happen! Let at least one of them die before my eyes!
My men are already on their way. Make sure they have something to plunder.
Now! Massacre them all!
