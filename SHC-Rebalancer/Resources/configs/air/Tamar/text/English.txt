Though Tamar loves her people, she will not hesitate to crush her enemies to dust when they threaten her kingdom. She is the embodiment of wisdom, majesty, and pride, and her armies are not just soldiers—they are justice delivered by the sword.
You step onto sacred ground... and you will die here, like all before you.
I do not hesitate to defend my people. You don't hesitate to flee.
The crown shines brightest when reflected in a sword.
Your ambitions end where my reign begins.
You have defiled the land I protect! You will pay for this!
You do not yet know the queen's wrath... but you will.
Think carefully... do you really want to stand against an entire kingdom?
Hm... a more tenacious foe than I expected.
Time to summon the knights... the war will truly ignite.
Let songs be sung of this victory!
You fell not before a soldier, but before a queen.
Justice has triumphed. My lands are safe.
You kneel not only before me—but before all of history.
I need supplies - the kingdom must endure this trial.
Thank you. Loyalty to the throne is always rewarded.
We have lost a loyal heart... let it be mourned.
You fought bravely. You are worthy of the kingdom.
I need no titles - my deeds speak of my greatness.
If you love this land, come to its aid.
The crown is heavy... but I bear the weight of this world without complaint.
Join.
Leave.
We march! Let the enemy’s gates fall before royal might!
Not now. The time has not yet come.
Strategy demands patience.
My forces are tied up... you must face fate alone.
A queen cannot be everywhere.
Unfortunately, my supplies are depleted.
Here is what I can give - may it serve you well.
We are victorious - let the world hear of it!
We must not retreat... nor break.
My knights are on the way - fight until they arrive.
I go forth! For the crown, for the people, for the future!
