Baldwin is a fortress lord and a lover of sieges. His army may not be the strongest offensively, but he is a master of prolonged defense. If a kingdom could be held with walls and diggers alone, he would be invincible.
Your forces look pathetic. Are you ready for defeat?
Sieges are an art. Unfortunately, you are painting a picture of failure!
Your ridiculous fortifications will crumble faster than you think!
Defend all you want - I will still defeat you.
You dare oppose me? That will be your biggest mistake!
I will not let scum like you destroy what I have built!
So be it... but do not forget who the true king of these lands is.
If my walls fall... we are doomed.
No! This cannot be the end... not yet!
Ha! Another victory - another triumph of my strategy!
You defended your lands well... but I do it better!
Every win brings me closer to ultimate dominance!
Your defeat was inevitable - did you not see it?
I need supplies if we are to win. Will you send them?
Sent supplies will be useful in the upcoming battle.
We lost an important ally... we must act cautiously.
A well-deserved victory - your strategy surprised me!
Only fools fight without a plan. That is why I always win!
My walls are under siege! I need your support!
War is not a race - it is a game of patience and strategy.
Ally?
Leave!
Time for a siege - their walls will not hold!
Not now. Let the enemy make the first mistake.
If I attack, it will be when the time is right.
My troops are too valuable to waste on someone else's mistakes.
Everyone should defend their own lands - as I do mine!
I cannot send anything now - I need everything for defense.
Your supplies are on the way - use them wisely.
Slowly but surely... our victory is near!
The enemy is gaining ground - we must regroup!
My knights are already on the way, prepare for support!
Time to attack! Let their walls crumble under our battering rams!
