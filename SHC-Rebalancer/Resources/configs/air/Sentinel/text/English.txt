The Sentinel is a merciless defender who never leaves his post. He is the symbol of unwavering defense, discipline, and obedience. His men are fanatical fortress guards, ready to die rather than let the enemy through the gate.
The walls will not fall as long as I stand here.
Try to come closer, and you’ll die before you touch the gate.
Every step you take is tracked by my eyes and my crossbows.
Only a fool charges without a chance. And I see a fool.
You’ve broken the order... and you will pay for it!
My patience has run out. Now I will answer with force!
Think carefully... is it worth dying for nothing?
Too many pressure points... I must regroup.
This wasn’t the expected path... but I will close it still.
No enemy has breached the walls. None have survived.
The guards didn’t sleep, and the enemy fell. As it should be.
Your attack was like wind – and I am the rock.
Another corpse at the gate. Time to bury you with the rest.
I need supplies. The walls do not defend themselves.
Good. These resources won’t go to waste.
A guard has fallen... but his place is already taken.
You defend well. Almost like one of my men.
My shield is order. My weapon – resolve.
All I need are reinforcements... and I will hold them all.
Day and night – the watch never sleeps.
Fine.
Leave.
Now it's their turn to taste a siege.
Defense is my weapon. It’s not time for offense.
I’ll stop them here... there’s no need to advance.
I cannot weaken the watch – not even for you.
Help? When I’m surrounded myself? Forgive me.
Resources are only for those who hold their post.
Take this. But don’t waste my trust.
The wall holds firm. The enemy retreats.
The walls are cracking... but the spirit of the sentinel lives on.
I’m sending guards. Do not fail them.
Open the gates... this time, we go out to meet them!
