Nomad is a mysterious, wandering warrior who has no permanent home and relies on lightly armored units, swift attacks, and mobility. His spearmen and horse archers are always ready for battle.
Have you prepared your walls? Ha! To me, they do not exist!
You will not find me, you will not catch me, you will not defeat me.
Your castles are prisons. My troops are as free as the wind.
Sitting in your fortress? Well, soon you might lose it.
You are delaying me for too long! You have lived for too long!
This is not the end... My warriors return like a storm!
A wise commander does not fight to the last. Do you know that concept?
I don’t like this situation... time to change the plan.
An opponent who does not move should not surprise me...
Your lands burn, your walls have fallen. I move on.
I have defeated you... and I vanish before you can rise again.
You tried to catch me? Ha! I won before you even started fighting!
You are just another settlement I have left in ruins.
I need more horses and bows. Get them for me.
Good. I remember those who were useful to me.
People come and go. Make sure my efforts are not wasted.
You fought well. Maybe you are not as weak as I thought.
I do not need walls, treasuries, or castles. I have freedom!
I need a few skilled warriors to help me, ally.
Rulers disappear, kingdoms fall... but I will always be on the road.
Interesting...
Weakling!
A siege? No... this is just another night raid.
Why? They are not running in panic yet.
Night attacks are more effective. Let’s wait.
I am not your guardian. Defend your lands yourself.
My horses do not go where the fight is not worth it.
I have everything I need, but nothing to spare.
Take this, but remember that I may return for more one day.
The enemies are retreating, their lands are ours!
This war is starting to overwhelm us. Maybe it’s time to withdraw...
My warriors are already galloping. Do not waste their time.
Now! Let their fortresses burn before they wake up!
