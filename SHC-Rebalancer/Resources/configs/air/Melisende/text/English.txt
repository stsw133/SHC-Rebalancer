Melisende is the embodiment of patience and wisdom. Her castle is well-fortified, and her economy flourishes, but don't expect her to rush into battle in the first minutes. If forced to fight, she will do so on her own terms.
Does your sword carry justice, or just steel?
The crown does not shine with blood... but it can still spill it.
You raise your hand against the legacy of the Holy City?
Ruling requires more than strength—something you lack.
You've disgraced your name, and now you'll disgrace your grave.
I do not tolerate betrayal, cowardice, or arrogance.
Don't think this is over... I haven't said my last word.
I must consider every move... this is no time for mistakes.
Has fortune turned? I cannot allow that!
Let this battle stand as proof of my will.
Wisdom and patience have triumphed once more!
My lineage does not fall—your pride already has.
No force can defeat a legacy built on unity.
I need support. Your loyalty will be rewarded.
It's good to know there are still allies one can count on.
We lost a valuable ally. We must be more cautious.
Your victory is worthy of a song.
Ruling is not just war—it is an art I have mastered.
The enemy is advancing! I will not surrender, but aid would help.
A kingdom is not land—it is those who defend it.
Someone new...
There is no place for me...
Surround them! Their walls won't stop a well-planned siege!
Not now... the time has not yet come.
I will not lower myself to attack in anger—only with reason.
Every ruler must be able to defend their own land.
My forces have more important objectives.
I need these resources—I cannot give them away.
May these gifts carry strength and hope.
Wisdom and unity will lead us to victory.
We must regroup—war is not won in a single battle.
Help is on the way—not out of pity, but out of duty.
We march. Not in anger, but in the name of justice.
