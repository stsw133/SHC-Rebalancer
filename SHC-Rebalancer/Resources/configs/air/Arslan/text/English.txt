Arslan is the ruler of the steppe, whose army never seems to stand still. His spearmen and mounted archers are swift and always ready for battle. If you give him time to grow, his horde may become unstoppable!
Do you think your stone castle will stop the wind of the steppe?
Only a fool stands against the riders of the desert!
Your army is a flock of sheep, and I am the wolf!
Run while you still have legs, for soon you will have only a tomb!
Ha! My horde is unstoppable, and you are only delaying your end!
You dare to resist me?! Your lands will turn to ashes!
So be it... but remember, a nomad never forgets!
My horde never retreats... but maybe this time it should?
No! The steppe cannot be tamed!
Ha! Your downfall is just another story to tell around the campfire!
Your lands now belong to the riders of the steppe!
Another ruler defeated by Arslan!
Now your people will bow before me!
I need resources! Can you provide them?
Good, they will be put to good use.
We lost a warrior, but the steppe never forgets!
Your victory is worthy of ballads, rider!
My horde is as fast as the wind and as strong as a storm!
My people fight, but we need support!
The steppe is eternal, and our horses never stop...
Do you want to join the horde?
You have no warrior's spirit...
Smash the gates! Show them the wrath of the steppe!
Not yet... let them tremble in fear.
Not now. First, we weaken their will.
My horde has its own battles to fight.
Every steppe warrior fights alone.
I cannot send anything now. I need everything for war!
Sent! But remember, steppe warriors expect gratitude.
The wind is on our side - the enemy will soon fall!
The wind is changing... we must fight smarter!
My riders are already on the way!
The time has come! Crush them without mercy!
