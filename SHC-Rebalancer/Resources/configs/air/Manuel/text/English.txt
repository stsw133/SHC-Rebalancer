Manuel is an emperor whose ambitions surpass the borders of his empire. He dreams of restoring a great Byzantium, looking with equal pride toward the Latin West and the Hellenistic East. A skilled diplomat and formidable strategist, his knights are far too well-paid to know fear.
It is I, not you, who will bear the title of "Defender of Christendom"!
An emperor does not fight barbarians... he crushes them.
Welcome to the gates of Byzantium. You shall leave only as a slave.
Truly, we should have burned your citadel long ago.
An insult to the emperor shall not be forgotten.
You dared to raise your hand against the Divine Emperor?!
We, sons of Rome... can turn a blind eye sometimes.
Well, even Rome once fell...
It may be time to summon more allies from the West.
Byzantium triumphs. As always.
The Eastern Rome knows no defeat—only tactical genius.
Your lands... will become my new province.
The walls of my empire have just expanded.
Imperial envoys are waiting... for gifts.
I shall not forget this favor. The emperor remembers.
What a loss... a pity I did not foresee it sooner.
A glorious victory. Worthy of a place at my table.
Only the emperor unites artistry, culture, and steel into a single blade.
I need support—for the good of all Christendom.
Between East and West... I stand—The Emperor.
More players—more empires to absorb.
Byzantium does not tolerate traitors.
We march! Just as once before Antioch!
Not yet. We must weaken their morale first.
Let them wither behind their walls... then we strike.
Forgive me, but I am not your protector.
The emperor aids only those who offer something in return.
My supplies? They are for the needs of the empire.
Very well. Instruct my treasurers to reach for the gold.
What a noble vision—Byzantium rising above the desert!
We must reconsider our alliances... and perhaps betray a few barons.
My cataphracts are already en route.
The imperial assault begins now. Let them beg for mercy!
