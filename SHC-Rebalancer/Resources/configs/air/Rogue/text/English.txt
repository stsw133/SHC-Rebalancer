The Rogue believes in neither laws, alliances, nor honor. He attacks for profit, betrays for fun, and his fortresses are merely a front for a gang of thugs and looters. The weakest in economy, but exceptionally dangerous if allowed to grow.
Castle? Treasury? I’m already excited to take it all!
Hide your gold, because my crew is already on the way!
Close the gates... or open them. We’ll get in either way.
They call me a thief... but you’ll be the one giving everything away!
You stole my loot? Now you’ll pay—with interest!
You’ll beg me to just rob you instead of killing you.
Wait. Maybe we can come to some sort of... agreement?
Huh... too quiet. I don’t like that.
Maybe I’ll back off for now... and come back with a knife in your back.
Richer from your gold... and with one less problem!
Look – even your dogs obey me now.
Victory? Nah, it was just a good heist!
Now I rule this sorry little kingdom!
Hand over what you’ve got... before I come take it myself.
Wow, really? Fine. Just don’t expect any gratitude.
He fled... too bad he didn’t take his debts with him.
Good trick! Maybe I’ll even spare you one day.
Betrayal? Looting? Chaos? That’s what real power looks like.
Hey, favor for a favor – right?
I’m always where gold smells fresh.
I’m in.
Betrayal?
Open up! One-two – and there’s nothing left of you.
Not yet. Better clean out his pockets first.
I’m waiting for someone to leave the gate open... as always.
Help? I’m no philanthropist, kid.
Do something for me, and then we’ll talk.
I’ve got nothing for you... unless you want a knife in the back.
Here. But only because I like being unpredictable.
Our pouches are full, and the enemy’s broke – I like this!
Someone’s not holding up their end of the deal...
Alright, a few of my lads will pay you a visit shortly.
I’m coming... and I’ll take everything that shines!
