Hugh once held a kingdom in his hands but failed to keep it. Although he tries to manage his castle, his indecisiveness often leaves his army unsure whether to attack or defend. This usually leads to his downfall.
Oh, come on! What kind of parody of an army stands before me?
You’d better surrender before you completely embarrass yourself!
You are trying to defend yourself? Well, that’s an effort... worthy of pity!
If your skills are as weak as your castle, then you’re done for!
Ha! Do you really think you can threaten me?! Pathetic!
No! It can’t end like this! My people, to battle!
Ugh... Alright, you won this duel. But next time, I’ll be the one on top!
Hm... Maybe I should have prepared this plan better...
Damn arrows! Why can’t my archers shoot as accurately as yours?!
Ha! That’s how a true knight fights!
Your downfall was inevitable, but I appreciate the effort.
Another victory! I am already used to this!
This would have been a great knightly tournament... if you were a better opponent!
I need steel and good wine. Can you provide at least one of these?
Ha! At least you have a shred of honor!
We lost a brave warrior. Time to avenge his name!
Well done! I suppose I can call you a knight.
No tournament, no battle, no siege - I have never lost!
I might have gotten ahead of myself here... I could use some help!
Honor and glory are one thing... but victory tastes the best!
Fine.
I am not welcome...
Time for real warfare - I’m starting the siege!
Relax, not yet. Let them sweat a little.
Just a moment... patience is a virtue, isn’t it?
You know, a knight should be able to handle things on his own...
Not this time. My troops are occupied elsewhere.
My supplies are for my people - sorry!
Here! But remember who saved your skin!
Ha! This is almost too easy!
Damn... I didn’t expect such a challenge!
My archers are already marching - don’t keep them waiting!
Knights, to battle! Time to crush the enemy!
