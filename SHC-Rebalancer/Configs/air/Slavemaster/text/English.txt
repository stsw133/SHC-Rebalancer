This ruler knows no mercy - because he does not acknowledge freedom. His fortresses are built by the hands of convicts, and his armies are crowds willing to die for a bowl of soup. The Slave Master respects no one - except himself. Few survive to tell of him.
Your people? They’ll be mine soon enough.
Why build... when you can enslave?
Every man has a price. Yours are cheap.
I saw your fortress. It'll make a fine mine.
Betrayal? My whip knows only one cure.
Scream louder. My men enjoy the sound of fear.
You can still kneel... and serve.
Hmpf... Perhaps I need to buy more loyalty.
My slaves are starting to whisper. Troubling.
Another city. Another hundred hands to work.
Your people are now my tools.
Their begging... was the song of victory.
Even the stones knelt before me.
Send me men. That’s not a request—it’s an order.
Your loyalty will be rewarded... with continued existence.
Ha! One less parasite to feed.
Not bad. Just think how many prisoners you’ve taken.
My strength is not an army. It's fear.
You wouldn't deny a request from the Master of Life and Death... would you?
They were rebels once. Now they’re bricks in my castle.
More slaves...
Get lost!
Move it! The work never stops—not even during war.
Let them starve. That’s a weapon too.
Why strike when you can wait for morale to rot?
No tyrant shares his whip.
My army isn’t for sale. Not yet.
Food? I don’t feed cattle with another man’s grain.
Take it. And remember who keeps you fed.
Slaves adore a winner.
My men are dying... but dying cheap.
I sent you a squad of loyalists... loyal to the bone.
The looting begins. And the funeral too.
