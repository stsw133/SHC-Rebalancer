Kahin is a mystical, enigmatic seer who seems to know more than others, and her prophecies are filled with cryptic metaphors. She is not only a prophetess but also a healer, which sometimes earns her the respect of even her enemies.
The stars have already written your fate... but you can still pray.
Time will complete its cycle... and you will find yourself in its shadow.
The storm is coming... and you stand in its path.
The evil you have done will return to you... sooner than you think.
You have crossed the threshold... now even the gods cannot save you from me!
You have forced me to abandon mercy... and choose vengeance.
Be careful... for at this very moment, you may be destroying your last chance at redemption.
The mist of the future grows darker... something eludes me.
Not everything follows the prophecy... this is troubling.
Your days were numbered... and now the last one has come.
Those who defy fate will eventually succumb to it.
You did not foresee this defeat? Well... I have seen it from the start.
It is time to erase your name from history... and write mine in its place.
For the good of us all... I need these resources.
Wise are those who understand that everything is part of a greater plan.
This was the time of my destiny... there is no escape from fate.
I see you are more capable than I thought... interesting.
I do not fight to win. I simply fulfill prophecies.
Balance must be maintained... come, and I shall repay you in kind.
Time knows no mercy... but I can grant you a moment of respite.
Let us see...
My time has come.
Every wall must one day fall... this is its time.
Not now. The stars have not yet given their sign.
Patience... we must wait for the right moment.
If you are worthy of my aid, destiny will preserve you.
My forces are engaged... this is no time to intervene.
If fate wills you to survive, you will find another path.
What I give is not a gift... but a part of a greater order.
Everything is unfolding as I have foreseen.
Time and the sands of the desert are fickle... they change the future in the blink of an eye.
I have sent you aid... but remember, debts owed to fate must always be repaid.
The prophecy is coming true... the enemy has nowhere left to run.
