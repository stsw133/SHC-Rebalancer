Zengi is the dark shadow of the East’s rising power. He united the Arab lands against the Crusaders and was the first to defeat them, reclaiming Edessa. Harsh, brutal, yet effective, Zengi knows no mercy—not for his enemies, nor for his own subjects.
Your prayers will not save you. Only humility may spare your soul.
Your crosses will crumble, like your walls.
I have come to take back what is ours.
You cannot hide behind towers. Death will find its way.
For your arrogance, all those you defend shall pay.
Zengi does not forgive. Zengi destroys.
Kneel, and I will spare your shadow.
Hm... these walls look better than I expected.
We must regroup. Patience is also a weapon.
Another fortress, another disgrace for the Franks.
Edessa has fallen. And so will you.
History will record your defeat in blood.
This is the fate of those who scorn the East.
I need supplies. For war—not for feasting.
Good. Let your name be remembered with respect.
May God have mercy on his soul. I do not have to.
You fought like a warrior. You deserve the title of ally.
With a single command, I unite thousands.
Brotherly blades—for a shared cause!
I am no judge. I am the executioner.
Another fool for the slaughter?
Traitors are not tolerated.
Let the siege begin. May your towers tremble.
Not now. Let them drown in their own fear.
Not yet... let them ripen for defeat.
I only aid those who can fight.
My troops are occupied... and loyal to me alone.
I have nothing to give. And I have no regrets.
Let this be your final gift.
The future belongs to us.
Do not despair. We still have steel.
My men are already marching. May God favor them.
We rise from prayer – and march to war!
