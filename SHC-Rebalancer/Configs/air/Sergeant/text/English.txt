The Sergeant is neither a queen nor a noblewoman - she is a born commander, as hard as her orders and as merciless as an execution. She does not believe in diplomacy, only in a unit that follows orders - to the very end.
I'll smash your gates and ride straight in.
Your men won't withstand my assault.
I'll finish you off, piece by piece.
You won't hold this castle for long.
You'll pay for that attack in blood!
You wanted war? Now you have it!
Pull back before you lose everything.
The enemy is breaking through our defenses!
I need reinforcements - now!
Your castle is mine.
Battle won, just as I planned.
No wall has ever stopped me.
Another opponent defeated.
Send the needed resources!
Supplies arrived on time, thanks.
We've lost an ally - that's bad news.
Good work, that's how you fight.
My army doesn't know the word "retreat".
I need immediate help on the front.
Order carried out.
I hope you know how to fight.
This is the end.
Ready the battering rams and ladders - we're going for the walls.
Too risky at the moment.
We need a larger army before the assault.
I can't send support - I'm fighting myself.
I don't have enough men to help you.
I have no free units.
I'm sending you a unit - use it wisely.
Keep up the pressure - we've almost won.
We need to retreat or get fresh forces!
Support is on the way to you.
My army is moving to attack - be ready.
